## ChickenVision 🐔👀

ChickenVision is a mobile app project that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to replace people's heads in a crowd with a chicken helmet. The app provides a fun and entertaining way to view crowds, and users can use their mobile phone's camera to scan a crowd and see the chicken helmet overlay on the heads of people in the frame. 

The app is built using an AR development kit, image recognition software, and a server or cloud service to process the images and replace the faces with the chicken helmet. The project is being developed by a team of developers and designers and is planned to be submitted to a hackathon.

The GitHub repository for the project is named "ChickenVision" and is hosted by the organization "projectPavoculus". We welcome contributions from anyone interested in the project, including developers, designers, and testers. 

If you're interested in contributing or have any questions about the project, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you for your interest in Pavoculus team 🦃!
