## ChickenVision🐔👀 is ...
> a mobile app project that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to replace people's heads in a crowd with a chicken helmet. The app's goal is to provide a fun and entertaining way to view crowds, and users can use their mobile phone's camera to scan a crowd and see the chicken helmet overlay on the heads of people in the frame. The app uses an AR development kit, image recognition software, and a server or cloud service to process the images and replace the faces with the chicken helmet. The project is being developed by a team of developers and designers and is planned to be submitted to a hackathon. The GitHub repository for the project is named "ChickenVision" and is hosted by the organization "projectPavoculus".
